# OSM History DB of Switzerland (osmhistorydb-ch)

## Overview
This is a project to implement a geospatial database containing the history (lineage) of OSM data objects, initiated by members of the SOSM community. 

The 'OSM History DB' being updated periodically from the original OSM database and it consists of a PostgreSQL database and software tools like ope, changesetmd.

There are many applications for this OSM History DB and the first one is to serve data for the '[Project of the Month Switzerland](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Project_of_the_month_Switzerland)' application. Another application could be to implement a new 'Permanent ID' service (which requires the version number of an OSM element).
